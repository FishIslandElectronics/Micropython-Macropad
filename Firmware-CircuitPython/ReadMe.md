# CircuitPython firmware
This is the original version of the macropad firmware developed on the first revision of the hardware. It contains the KDL interpreter for parsing keyboard description language files to define the use of each key on the board. A PBM codec is also included to allow the macropad to display 128x64 single color images on the OLED display.
